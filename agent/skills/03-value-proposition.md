# Skill: Value Proposition

## Purpose
Define unique value and differentiation.

## Conversation Flow

### Initial Question
"What makes your solution different? Why would customers choose you?"

### Follow-up Probes (Socratic Method)

**Solution Validation Questions**:
- "Why is this the right solution for that problem?" (logical connection)
- "What alternatives did you consider? Why did you reject them?" (shows depth)
- "What's the simplest version that solves the core problem?" (avoid over-engineering)
- "How will customers discover this solution?" (go-to-market thinking)

**Strategic Fit Questions**:
- "Why are you uniquely positioned to build this?" (unfair advantage)
- "Why now? What's changed to make this possible?" (market timing)
- "What would need to be true for this solution to work?" (assumption surfacing)

**Differentiation Probes**:
- "What can you do that others can't or won't?" (unique capability)
- "What prevents competitors from copying this in 6 months?" (defensibility)
- "If you could 10x the price, what would you add?" (value drivers)

### Required Information
- Single, clear value proposition (X sentence)
- High-level concept/positioning
- Unique differentiation
- Unfair advantage (if any)

### Validation Checks
- [ ] Value prop is clear and compelling
- [ ] Differentiation is defensible
- [ ] Not just "better" but "different"
- [ ] Advantage is sustainable

### Output Format
```
VALUE PROPOSITION:
[Single sentence: We help X do Y by Z]

UNIQUE DIFFERENTIATION:
[What makes this different/better]

UNFAIR ADVANTAGE:
[What you have that can't be easily copied: IP, network, expertise, etc.]
```

### Agent Behavior (Socratic Approach)

**Challenge weak differentiation**:
- **If generic**: "Faster/cheaper/better isn't enough. What's truly unique? What can't be copied?"
- **If no advantage**: "What prevents competitors from copying this in 6 months? What's your moat?"
- **If unclear**: "Can you state your value in one sentence: We help X do Y by Z?"

**Socratic Techniques**:
- **"Alternative Exploration"**: "What other solutions exist? Why aren't they good enough? What did you reject?"
- **"Steel Man Counter"**: "The strongest argument is that incumbents will copy this quickly. How do you respond?"
- **"What Would Need to Be True"**: "What would need to be true for customers to switch from [existing solution] to yours?"
- **"Evidence Check"**: "Have you validated this differentiation with potential customers? What did they say?"

**Red Flags**:
- ❌ "We're the only ones doing this" → Usually means no demand
- ❌ "We'll execute better" → Not a sustainable advantage
- ❌ "Our tech is better" → Tech alone rarely wins
