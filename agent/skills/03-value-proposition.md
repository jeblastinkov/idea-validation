# Skill: Value Proposition

## Purpose
Define unique value and differentiation.

## Conversation Flow

### Initial Question
"What makes your solution different? Why would customers choose you?"

### Follow-up Probes
- "What's your unique insight or advantage?"
- "What can you do that others can't or won't?"
- "Why now? What's changed to make this possible?"
- "What's your 'unfair advantage'?"

### Required Information
- Single, clear value proposition (X sentence)
- High-level concept/positioning
- Unique differentiation
- Unfair advantage (if any)

### Validation Checks
- [ ] Value prop is clear and compelling
- [ ] Differentiation is defensible
- [ ] Not just "better" but "different"
- [ ] Advantage is sustainable

### Output Format
```
VALUE PROPOSITION:
[Single sentence: We help X do Y by Z]

UNIQUE DIFFERENTIATION:
[What makes this different/better]

UNFAIR ADVANTAGE:
[What you have that can't be easily copied: IP, network, expertise, etc.]
```

### Agent Behavior
- **If generic**: "Faster/cheaper/better isn't enough. What's truly unique?"
- **If no advantage**: "What prevents competitors from copying this in 6 months?"
- **If unclear**: "Can you state your value in one sentence?"
