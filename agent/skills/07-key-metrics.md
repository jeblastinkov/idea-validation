# Skill: Key Metrics

## Purpose
Define success metrics and validation criteria.

## Conversation Flow

### Initial Question
"How will you measure success? What metrics matter most?"

### Follow-up Probes (Socratic Method)

**Success Criteria Questions**:
- "How will we know if this idea is successful?" (specific outcomes)
- "What would make you consider this idea a failure?" (failure criteria)
- "What metric are we trying to move? By how much?" (quantified targets)
- "What customer behavior change are we looking for?" (beyond vanity metrics)
- "What's the adoption target for the first 6 months?" (realistic expectations)

**Validation Probes**:
- "What's your key metric (the one number that matters)?" (North Star)
- "How will you track this metric?" (measurement plan)
- "What result would prove/disprove this idea?" (validation criteria)
- "What's your timeline for validation?" (when to decide)

### Required Information
- Key metric (North Star)
- 2-3 supporting metrics
- Validation criteria (what proves this works)
- Timeline for initial validation

### Validation Checks
- [ ] Metrics are measurable
- [ ] Metrics drive decision-making
- [ ] Success criteria are clear
- [ ] Metrics match business model

### Output Format
```
KEY METRIC:
[Primary success indicator]

SUPPORTING METRICS:
- [Metric 2]
- [Metric 3]

VALIDATION CRITERIA:
[What result validates the idea? What invalidates it?]
```

### Agent Behavior (Socratic Approach)

**Challenge weak metrics**:
- **If too many metrics**: "What's THE metric that shows you're succeeding? Pick one."
- **If vanity metrics**: "Downloads don't equal success. What behavior change shows real value?"
- **If no criteria**: "What specific result would make you stop or pivot?"
- **If unrealistic**: "How did you arrive at that target? What's the basis?"

**Socratic Techniques**:
- **"What Would Need to Be True"**: "What would need to be true to hit that target?"
- **"Evidence Check"**: "What evidence suggests this metric is achievable?"
- **"Second-Order Consequences"**: "If you hit this metric, what happens next? What's the next bottleneck?"
- **"Steel Man Counter"**: "Some might say this metric is a vanity metric. How would you prove it drives real business value?"

**Red Flags**:
- ❌ "We'll get 10,000 users in month 1" → Unrealistic without distribution
- ❌ Only tracking signups/downloads → Not tracking engagement/value
- ❌ No failure criteria → Can't invalidate the idea
