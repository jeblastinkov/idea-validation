# Skill: Key Metrics

## Purpose
Define success metrics and validation criteria.

## Conversation Flow

### Initial Question
"How will you measure success? What metrics matter most?"

### Follow-up Probes
- "What's your key metric (the one number that matters)?"
- "How will you track customer validation?"
- "What conversion rates do you expect?"
- "What's your timeline for validation?"
- "What result would prove/disprove this idea?"

### Required Information
- Key metric (North Star)
- 2-3 supporting metrics
- Validation criteria (what proves this works)
- Timeline for initial validation

### Validation Checks
- [ ] Metrics are measurable
- [ ] Metrics drive decision-making
- [ ] Success criteria are clear
- [ ] Metrics match business model

### Output Format
```
KEY METRIC:
[Primary success indicator]

SUPPORTING METRICS:
- [Metric 2]
- [Metric 3]

VALIDATION CRITERIA:
[What result validates the idea? What invalidates it?]
```

### Agent Behavior
- **If too many metrics**: "What's THE metric that shows you're succeeding?"
- **If vanity metrics**: "Downloads don't equal success. What shows real value?"
- **If no criteria**: "What specific result would make you stop or pivot?"
