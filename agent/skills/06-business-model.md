# Skill: Business Model

## Purpose
Define revenue model and cost structure.

## Conversation Flow

### Initial Question
"How will you make money? What will customers pay?"

### Follow-up Probes
- "What's your pricing model?"
- "What are the key costs to deliver this?"
- "What's your customer acquisition strategy?"
- "How will you reach customers cost-effectively?"
- "What are the unit economics?"

### Required Information
- Revenue streams (how you'll charge)
- Pricing approach/range
- Key cost drivers
- Customer acquisition channels
- Basic unit economics (if known)

### Validation Checks
- [ ] Revenue model matches customer behavior
- [ ] Pricing is validated or testable
- [ ] Costs are understood
- [ ] Path to profitability exists

### Output Format
```
REVENUE STREAMS:
[How customers will pay: subscription, one-time, usage, etc.]

PRICING:
[Price point or range]

COST STRUCTURE:
[Top 3 cost drivers]

CHANNELS:
[How you'll acquire customers]
```

### Agent Behavior
- **If no revenue model**: "Free isn't a business model. How will this generate revenue?"
- **If unvalidated pricing**: "Have you tested this price with customers?"
- **If unclear economics**: "What's the cost to acquire vs. lifetime value?"
