# SVPG Opportunity Assessment

## Overview
The Opportunity Assessment is a framework from Marty Cagan and the Silicon Valley Product Group (SVPG) for evaluating product opportunities.

## When to Use
- **Existing products**: When you already have a product and team
- **Feature prioritization**: Deciding what to build next
- **Ongoing discovery**: Continuous product development
- **Opportunity evaluation**: Comparing multiple opportunities

## Key Difference from Lean Canvas
- **Lean Canvas**: For new businesses/products (pre-product)
- **Opportunity Assessment**: For existing products/teams (post-product)

## The 10 Questions

### 1. What problem will this solve?
**Objective**: Is the problem real and worth solving?

- What's the customer pain point?
- Is it a must-have or nice-to-have?
- How do we know it's a real problem?

### 2. For whom do we solve that problem?
**Objective**: Who is the target user/customer?

- Specific user persona
- How many people have this problem?
- Can we reach them?

### 3. How big is the opportunity?
**Objective**: Is it worth the investment?

- Market size (TAM/SAM/SOM)
- Revenue potential
- Strategic importance
- Competitive positioning

### 4. What alternatives are out there?
**Objective**: What's the competitive landscape?

- How do users solve this today?
- Direct competitors
- Indirect alternatives
- Why will customers switch?

### 5. Why are we best suited to pursue this?
**Objective**: What's our unique advantage?

- Strategic fit
- Technical capabilities
- Customer relationships
- Unfair advantage

### 6. Why now?
**Objective**: What's the urgency/timing?

- Market timing
- Technology enablers
- Competitive threats
- Customer readiness

### 7. How will we get this product to market?
**Objective**: What's the GTM strategy?

- Channels
- Partnerships
- Sales approach
- Marketing strategy

### 8. How will we measure success?
**Objective**: What are the success criteria?

- Key metrics
- Leading indicators
- Success threshold
- Timeline

### 9. What factors are critical to success?
**Objective**: What must go right?

- Dependencies
- Required capabilities
- Resources needed
- Risks to manage

### 10. What are the risks?
**Objective**: What could go wrong?

- Market risk (will they want it?)
- Technical risk (can we build it?)
- Business risk (can we monetize it?)
- Execution risk (can we deliver it?)

## Assessment Template

```markdown
# Opportunity Assessment: [Product/Feature Name]

## 1. Problem
[What problem does this solve?]

## 2. Target Customer
[For whom?]

## 3. Opportunity Size
[How big is the opportunity?]

## 4. Alternatives
[What are the alternatives?]

## 5. Our Advantage
[Why us?]

## 6. Timing
[Why now?]

## 7. Go-to-Market
[How will we reach customers?]

## 8. Success Metrics
[How will we measure success?]

## 9. Critical Success Factors
[What must go right?]

## 10. Risks
[What could go wrong?]

---

**Recommendation**: [Pursue / Don't Pursue / Need More Discovery]
**Biggest Risk**: [What's the riskiest assumption?]
**Next Step**: [What's the first validation experiment?]
```

## Validation Approach

### Discovery Process
1. **Product discovery**: Rapid prototyping and testing
2. **Customer engagement**: Talk to users continuously
3. **Technical feasibility**: Prove it can be built
4. **Business viability**: Validate monetization

### Risk Prioritization
Test risks in order of:
1. **Value risk**: Will customers buy/use it?
2. **Usability risk**: Can users figure out how to use it?
3. **Feasibility risk**: Can we build it?
4. **Business viability risk**: Will it work for our business?

## When to Use Each Framework

| Situation | Use Lean Canvas | Use Opportunity Assessment |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------------|
| New startup | ✓ | |
| New product line | ✓ | |
| Existing product | | ✓ |
| Feature prioritization | | ✓ |
| No team yet | ✓ | |
| Established team | | ✓ |
| Pre-funding | ✓ | |
| Post-product | | ✓ |

## Integration with Agent

The agent can optionally use Opportunity Assessment format when:
- User has an existing product
- User is evaluating a specific feature
- User prefers SVPG methodology
- Context is ongoing product development

However, **Lean Canvas is the default** for this agent because:
- Most users are validating new ideas
- One-page format is more actionable
- Covers business model (revenue/costs)
- Better for pre-product validation
