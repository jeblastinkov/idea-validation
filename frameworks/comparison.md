### Limitations
- ❌ Assumes existing product/team
- ❌ Less useful for business model
- ❌ No revenue/cost structure
- ❌ Requires market knowledge

- Product discovery
- Resource allocation
- Existing product evolution

## Value Proposition Canvas

### Strengths
- ✅ Deep customer understanding
- ✅ Jobs-to-be-done integration
- ✅ Pain/gain mapping
- ✅ Product-market fit focused
- ✅ Customer-centric

### Limitations
- ❌ Doesn't cover business model
- ❌ No competitive analysis
- ❌ No cost/revenue structure
- ❌ Requires customer research

### Best Use Cases
- Customer discovery
- Problem validation
- Feature prioritization
- Positioning/messaging
- Jobs-to-be-done research

## Hybrid Approach

### Recommended Sequence for New Ideas
1. **Start**: Value Proposition Canvas
   - Understand customer deeply
   - Validate problem/solution fit

2. **Then**: Lean Canvas
   - Build full business model
   - Identify all key assumptions

3. **Finally**: Experiments
   - Test riskiest assumptions
   - Iterate based on learning

### For Ongoing Products
1. **Start**: Opportunity Assessment
   - Evaluate strategic fit
   - Assess opportunity size

2. **Then**: Value Proposition Canvas (if needed)
   - Deepen customer understanding
   - Validate specific features

3. **Finally**: Product discovery
   - Prototypes and tests
   - Continuous iteration

## Our Agent's Choice: Lean Canvas

### Why Lean Canvas as Default

**Primary reasons:**
1. **Comprehensive**: Covers problem, solution, AND business model
2. **Actionable**: One-page output users can use immediately
3. **Stage-appropriate**: Most users are pre-product
4. **Accessible**: Widely understood framework
5. **Downloadable**: Easy to share as .md file

**Secondary benefits:**
- Forces discipline (one page limit)
- Highlights riskiest assumptions
- Maps directly to validation experiments
- Works for B2B and B2C
- Balances speed with thoroughness

### When to Suggest Alternatives

**Suggest Opportunity Assessment when:**
- User mentions existing product
- User is part of established company
- User is evaluating features, not full business
- User explicitly requests SVPG approach

**Suggest Value Proposition Canvas when:**
- User needs customer research focus
- Problem/solution fit is unclear
- User wants jobs-to-be-done approach
- Deeper customer psychology needed

## Socratic Questioning: A Universal Methodology

**NEW**: Socratic Questioning is not a framework, but a questioning methodology that enhances ALL frameworks.

### What is Socratic Questioning?

A method of rigorous inquiry through targeted questions that:
- Uncovers assumptions
- Clarifies fuzzy thinking
- Surfaces potential issues early
- Strengthens reasoning

**See**: `/frameworks/socratic-questioning.md` for complete guide

### The 5 Socratic Categories

1. **Problem Clarity** - "What specific pain? Who has it? How do you know?"
2. **Solution Validation** - "Why this solution? What alternatives exist?"
3. **Success Criteria** - "How will we measure success? What constitutes failure?"
4. **Constraints & Trade-offs** - "What are we NOT doing? What if you had half the resources?"
5. **Strategic Fit** - "Why now? Why you? What if we wait?"

### How Socratic Questioning Enhances Frameworks

**With Lean Canvas:**
- Problem section → Use Problem Clarity questions
- Solution section → Use Solution Validation + Constraints questions
- Metrics section → Use Success Criteria questions
- Unfair Advantage → Use Strategic Fit questions

**With SVPG Opportunity Assessment:**
- "What problem?" → Enhanced with Problem Clarity probes
- "Why us? Why now?" → Enhanced with Strategic Fit challenges
- "Success metrics?" → Enhanced with Success Criteria questions
- "Risks?" → Enhanced with Constraint questions

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Deeper, more rigorous thinking
- ✅ Better evidence gathering
- ✅ Clearer assumptions identification
- ✅ Stronger validation outcomes

**Agent Integration:**
Our validation agent uses Socratic techniques throughout all 9 skills to ensure high-quality answers.

## Validation Principles (Universal)

Regardless of framework, always:

1. **Problem First**
   - Validate problem before solution
   - Talk to customers early and often
   - Use Socratic probing: "How do you know this is a real problem?"

2. **Assumptions Explicit**
   - List what you're assuming
   - Identify riskiest assumptions
   - Test highest risk first
   - Use Socratic technique: "What would need to be true for this to work?"

3. **Evidence-Based**
   - Don't hallucinate data
   - Mark unknowns clearly
   - Update based on learning
   - Use Socratic challenge: "What evidence supports this claim?"

4. **Iterative**
   - Validate, learn, update
   - Expect to pivot
   - Canvas is living document
   - Use Socratic probe: "If you had half the time, what would you cut?"

5. **Action-Oriented**
   - Every assumption → experiment
   - Every risk → test
   - Every unknown → research plan
   - Use Socratic question: "How will you test this assumption?"

## Framework Evolution

### Lean Canvas Variations
- **Lean Product Canvas** (2025): Updated with UX focus
- **Platform Canvas**: For platform businesses
- **Impact Canvas**: For social enterprises

### SVPG Evolution
- Originally 4 risks (value, usability, feasibility, viability)
- Expanded to 10-question format
- Now includes Empowered model

### Integration Trends
Modern product teams often use:
- Opportunity Assessment → Lean Canvas → Experiments
- Or: Jobs-to-be-Done → Value Prop Canvas → Lean Canvas
