**Next Action**: Beta test with 15 consultants THIS WEEK | Need 10/15 regular usage to proceed | Week 2 decision gate

---

## 1️⃣ Problem

**What**: AI coding assistants (Claude, Copilot, ChatGPT) hallucinate when generating Resco code—lack JSBridge docs (can't find online) + Dataverse schema access + sync log troubleshooting

**Impact**: Consultants waste time manually searching Resco Wikipedia, looking up schemas, debugging sync issues → errors + frustration

**Severity**: [x] Must-have | [ ] Should-have | [ ] Nice-to-have

**Evidence**: Observed consultants struggling with AI hallucinations | AI can't crawl/find Resco JSBridge docs → incorrect code generation

---

## 2️⃣ Target Customer

**Primary**: Senior functional consultants at MS Dynamics 365 implementation partners (100-250 employees) building Resco apps monthly

**Secondary**: In-house enterprise teams maintaining business applications

**Market**: 15,000 consultants globally (3K MS partners × 175 employees × 30% consultants × 10% Resco) | 16 active Resco partners | Western Europe + US

**Accessibility**: Direct via 16 partners | Copilot Studio marketplace | MS Dynamics communities | Resco docs integration

---

## 3️⃣ Opportunity Size

**Market**: TAM 15K consultants | SAM 80 (16 partners) | SOM 20-50 Year 1

**Revenue** (indirect - free MCP drives Resco licenses):
- Per project: 20 users × €10/month × 24 months = €4,800
- Year 1: 8+ projects = €38,400+
- Year 2-3: 11+ projects/year = €52,800+ annually

**Investment**: €37.5K Year 1 | Break-even: 8 projects (156 users)

**Strategic Importance**: Competitive defense vs Power Platform (vibe.powerapps.com) | Prevents consultant defection to Microsoft | Retains mindshare in MS ecosystem | Reinforces 25-year mobile-first, backend-agnostic positioning

**Strategic value >> direct revenue** - this is market position, not just €38K

---

## 4️⃣ Alternatives & Differentiation

**Current solutions**:
1. Manual Resco Wikipedia searches (slow, expertise-intensive)
2. ChatGPT with manual uploads (incomplete, hallucinates, no live schema)
3. Hire developers (expensive, slow)
4. Switch to Power Platform (lose offline-first + backend-agnostic advantages)

**Competitors**: vibe.powerapps.com (Power Apps AI tool) | Salesforce (building similar) | Microsoft/Resco native MCP (very likely, imminent threat)

**Differentiation**: Only MCP for Resco | Direct Dataverse connection + full docs (zero hallucination) | Eliminates context switching | 10x faster (requires validation) | Enables self-service vs hiring devs

---

## 5️⃣ Why RESCO

**Strategic fit**: Drives core Resco platform adoption | Prevents Power Platform defection | Enables 16-partner ecosystem

**Unique capabilities**:
- Proprietary Resco JSBridge documentation (can't be replicated)
- 25 years mobile-first expertise
- Backend agnostic (Dataverse, Salesforce, ServiceNow vs Power Platform lock-in)
- Offline-first architecture (vs Power Platform online-first)
- 16-partner network (distribution + feedback)
- Deep consultant workflow knowledge

**Unfair advantage**: Documentation monopoly—only company with full Resco JSBridge docs to feed AI tools

---

## 6️⃣ Why Now

**Market timing**: AI coding assistants (Claude, Copilot, ChatGPT) now mainstream for developers/consultants | Market expects AI-assisted workflows

**Technology**: MCP protocol available | Copilot Studio marketplace provides distribution

**Competitive threat**: Microsoft/Resco likely building native solution | **First-mover window: 1 week to few months**

**Customer readiness**: Consultants already using AI daily, asking for Resco-specific support

**Urgency**: VERY HIGH - launch in 1 week or risk commoditization

---

**Remaining**: Code accuracy validation (>70% correct) in beta

---

### Business Viability Risk: Does it work for our business?
**Level**: [ ] Medium [ ] High [x] Low

**Why**: €37.5K manageable | Indirect revenue model proven | Year 1 negative acceptable | Strategic value >> direct ROI | €15K/year sustainable

**Break-even**: Year 1: 8 projects | Year 2+: 3 projects | Achievable if adoption validates

---

## 🎯 Recommendation: PURSUE

**Decision**: [x] PURSUE | [ ] EXPLORE | [ ] HOLD | [ ] PASS

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Critical strategic need (competitive defense vs Power Platform)
- ✅ Clear problem (field evidence, must-have severity)
- ✅ Low tech/business risk (€37.5K manageable, ROI clear)
- ✅ Unique advantage (proprietary docs monopoly)
- ✅ Urgent timing (first-mover window closing)
- ⚠️ Medium adoption risk (mitigated by beta validation)
- ⚠️ No moat beyond speed (launch fast, establish base before competition)

**This is a speed play with high strategic value and acceptable risk. Recommend aggressive pursuit with disciplined validation.**

---

## 🚨 Biggest Risk & Test Plan

**Risk**: Consultants won't adopt despite availability (Value = Medium) + Competitive timing (Very High)

**Combined threat**: Low adoption + Microsoft/Resco launches native = lose on both fronts

### Beta Test Plan (THIS WEEK)

**Setup**:
- Recruit: 5 internal Resco + 10 partner consultants
- Demo: Hands-on MCP setup + Claude/Copilot Studio integration
- Assign: Real project (build Resco offline HTML for actual client)
- Observe: 1 week usage

**Measure**:
- Usage frequency (daily/weekly/never)
- Time savings (really 5-10x faster?)
- Code accuracy (hallucination reduction, manual corrections)
- Recommendation intent (viral potential)
- Willingness to pay (value signal, even though free)

**Decision (Week 2)**:
- ✅ 10+ regular users → Launch to marketplace
- ⚠️ 5-9 users → Fix friction, iterate, retest
- ❌ <5 users → Stop or pivot to partnership

**Why critical**: If won't use when free + supported, won't use at scale. Validate adoption BEFORE broader distribution.

**Backup plan**: Partnership approach—contribute MCP to Microsoft/Resco as official solution vs competing standalone
