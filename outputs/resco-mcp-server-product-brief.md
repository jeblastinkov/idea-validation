## Resco MCP Server: Your AI assistant finally knows Resco.

**For functional consultants building Resco mobile apps — so your AI writes accurate code on the first try, not hallucinated guesses.**

---

### The Villain

You ask your AI assistant to generate Resco code, and it confidently writes something that looks right — but doesn't work. It's hallucinating. It has never seen the Resco JSBridge documentation and has no idea what tables or fields exist in your client's system. So you spend the next hour hunting through Resco Wikipedia, copying entity names by hand, and fixing code the AI got wrong. The tool that was supposed to save you time just doubled your work.

---

### The Hero

Now your AI assistant has direct access to the full Resco documentation and your client's live data structure. You describe what you need in plain language, and the AI generates code that actually works — because it knows every JSBridge method, every entity, every field in your specific project. When a sync issue hits, you don't dig through logs alone. You ask your AI, and it pinpoints the problem in seconds.

---

### The Magic

**Accurate code, first try.** Your AI reads the complete Resco JSBridge documentation, so it stops guessing and starts generating code that actually runs.

**Your data, your context.** The AI sees your client's exact tables, fields, and relationships — no more manual lookups or copy-paste errors.

**Sync issues, solved fast.** Point the AI at a sync log and get a clear explanation of what went wrong and how to fix it, instead of hours of troubleshooting.

---

### Why Now?

AI coding assistants are everywhere, but they're useless for Resco without the right context. Every day without this, your consultants waste hours on work the AI could do in minutes — and your competitors using Power Apps already have AI that knows their platform.

---

### The Evidence

> Consultants spend an estimated 5-10 hours per project manually searching Resco documentation and troubleshooting sync issues — time that compounds across the 15,000 consultants building Resco apps globally.
