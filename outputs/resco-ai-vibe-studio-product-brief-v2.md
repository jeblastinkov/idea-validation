## Resco AI Vibe Studio: Offline field apps from a conversation. Any CRM. No build step.

**For implementation consultants who need to deliver offline mobile field apps across Dynamics, Salesforce, or ServiceNow — but are blocked by platform lock-in, missing offline, and compilation complexity — so they go from a natural language description to a working app on their phone in under 30 minutes.**

---

### The Villain

Your client needs a mobile app for technicians in the field. Simple enough request — until reality hits. Power Apps Vibe? Microsoft only, and offline just appeared on the roadmap. Salesforce MAGE? It generates an empty Xcode project — you still need Swift developers, signing certificates, and an App Store submission. ServiceNow Build Agent? Impressive, but its Mobile App Builder has zero offline support. So you're facing the same wall every time: one vendor's tool, one vendor's limits, and a client who needs it to work underground, in a warehouse, or in the middle of nowhere.

### The Hero

Open vibe.resco.net. Pick a field service template — work orders, inspections, inventory checks. Tell the AI what to customize: "add a photo capture step, connect to our Dynamics work order table, show only today's assignments." Scan a QR code. The app is on your phone, running with real data, working fully offline. No Xcode. No Android Studio. No app store submission. No compilation of any kind. Change something with a follow-up prompt and it updates live on your device. When your client says "can you make it work with our Salesforce org too?" — you just connect a second backend.

### The Magic

**Offline that actually works.** Not "coming soon." Not "requires custom SDK development." Not "limited mode." Full offline with encrypted data, automatic sync, proven by 2,500 companies in production for 18 years. Your technician walks into a tunnel and the app keeps working.

**Any CRM, same app.** Dynamics 365, Salesforce, ServiceNow — connect any of them. Your competitors' tools only work with their own platform. Resco works with all three. Build once, deploy everywhere.

**On your phone in minutes, not months.** No Xcode project to configure. No signing certificates. No App Store review. No Android build variants. Describe the app, scan a QR code, it's running. What Salesforce MAGE gives you is an empty project skeleton you still need to build. What Resco gives you is a finished app on your phone.

### Why Now?

Every platform vendor just shipped an AI app builder — but every one of them is locked to their own ecosystem and weak on mobile offline. Microsoft is adding "offline by default" to Power Apps in 2026. Salesforce MAGE generates native scaffolds but requires developers to implement offline manually. ServiceNow's Mobile App Builder still has zero offline support. The window to own "offline-first, any-CRM, no-compile" is 3 to 6 months before the platform vendors close their gaps.

---

### The Evidence

> ServiceNow's Mobile App Builder does not support offline mode natively — custom Mobile SDK development is required for true offline capability. Salesforce MAGE generates project scaffolds, not finished apps — developers still need Swift and Kotlin skills, which are "often in short supply" (Salesforce). 60%+ of field service orgs plan mobile apps within 3 years (Gartner), yet no major platform delivers turnkey offline today.
