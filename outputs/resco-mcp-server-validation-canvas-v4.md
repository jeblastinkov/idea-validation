# Lean Canvas: Resco MCP Server

**Date**: 2026-02-08 | **Version**: 4.0 | **Status**: Pre-Launch — Validated

---

## Executive Summary

**What**: Free MCP server giving AI coding assistants access to Resco JSBridge docs + client Dataverse schemas. Eliminates hallucinations when building Resco apps.

**Who**: ~15,000 senior functional consultants at MS implementation partners globally.

**Cost**: €37.5K Year 1 (€22.5K build + €15K maintenance). Break-even at 8 projects (~160 users). Expected Year 1: 4-5 projects = -€13-18K (acceptable). Profitable Year 2-3.

**Key risk**: Adoption (behavior change) + Microsoft/Resco likely building native solution + no defensible moat.

**Next action**: Beta with 15 consultants THIS WEEK. Need 10/15 regular usage to proceed.

**Verdict**: STRONG — Low risk, high strategic value. Even partial adoption pays for itself. Builds essential infrastructure for Vibe Studio.

---

## Problem

1. AI assistants hallucinate Resco code — missing JSBridge docs
2. Consultants waste hours searching Resco Wikipedia and troubleshooting sync
3. AI tools can't access client Dataverse schemas — manual lookups, frequent errors

**Alternatives**: Manual wiki search (slow) | ChatGPT + uploaded docs (still hallucinates) | Hire devs (expensive) | Switch to Power Platform (lose offline-first)

---

## Customer

**Primary**: Senior functional consultants at MS D365 partners (100-250 employees), building Resco mobile apps monthly.

**Market**: ~15,000 consultants globally. 16 active Resco partners (80 potential early users). Western Europe + US.

**Reach**: Resco partner network | MS Copilot Studio marketplace | LinkedIn groups/forums

---

## Value Proposition

**"AI assistants that actually know Resco JSBridge and your Dataverse structure."**

- vs Manual ChatGPT: Live Dataverse connection + full docs = zero hallucination
- vs vibe.powerapps.com: Only solution for Resco ecosystem
- vs Manual search: Automatic AI context, no switching

---

## Solution (MVP — 3 tools)

1. **JSBridge doc search** — AI-accessible Resco Wikipedia
2. **Dataverse schema access** — List entities/tables/fields from client org
3. **Sync log analysis** — AI-assisted troubleshooting

**Delivery**: MCP server for Claude, Copilot Studio, other MCP tools. Published to Copilot Studio marketplace.

**NOT in MVP**: Workflow builder | Code templates | Multi-org | Analytics | Mobile preview | Code review

---

## Unfair Advantage

**Strengths**:
- MCP ecosystem mature: 97M+ monthly SDK downloads, 5,800+ servers, enterprise-deployed. Production-ready.
- Copilot Studio marketplace: native MCP support, real distribution channel.
- Low cost, high strategic value: cheapest way to accelerate Resco adoption + build Vibe Studio foundation.
- Synergy: MCP provides the AI context layer Vibe Studio needs for code generation.

**Moat**: First-mover only. No tech moat — easily replicable. Speed is the advantage. Even if commoditized, wins if it accelerates Resco adoption and builds Vibe Studio infrastructure.

## Channels

**Primary**: Copilot Studio marketplace (organic discovery)

**Early adopters**: 16 Resco partners → 5 internal + 10 partner consultants

**Launch**: Week 1-2 beta → Week 3 marketplace launch → Week 4+ community + webinars

---

## Economics

**Model**: Free tool → more consultants build Resco apps → more projects → more licenses (€10/user/month)

**Per-project**: 20 users × €10/month × 24 months = €4,800

| | Amount |
|---|---|
| Build | €22,500 (1.5 FTE × 3 months) |
| Annual maintenance | €15,000 |
| **Year 1 total** | **€37,500** |
| Break-even Year 1 | 8 projects (156 users) |
| Break-even Year 2+ | 3 projects/year |
| Year 1 forecast | 4-5 projects = €19-24K = **-€13-18K net** |

Profitable Year 2-3 as adoption scales to 11+ projects/year.

## Key Metrics

**North Star**: Monthly active consultants using MCP.

| Target | 6 months | 12 months |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| Active users | 20 | 50+ |
| Tool uses | 500+ | — |
| Projects with MCP | — | 8+ |
| End-users on MCP-built UIs | — | 156+ |

## Critical Risks

| # | Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|------|----------|------------|
| 1 | **Adoption**: Consultants don't use it | HIGHEST | Beta: need 10/15 regular usage |
| 2 | **Competition**: MS/Resco builds native solution | VERY HIGH | Speed (1-week launch), partnership pivot |
| 3 | **No moat**: Easily replicable | HIGH | None beyond speed |
| 4 | **Value**: Time savings < 5x | MEDIUM | Measure in beta |
| 5 | **Distribution**: Copilot Studio approval delayed | MEDIUM | Claude/other MCP tools as backup |

**Unvalidated**: 10x speed claim | 15K market size | viral coefficient | MS/Resco timeline | consultant tool authority | retention

---

## Next Steps

**THIS WEEK: Beta with 15 consultants** (5 internal + 10 partners)

**Measure**: Usage rate, frequency, time savings, code accuracy, recommendation intent.

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| 10+ regular users | Launch to Copilot Studio marketplace Week 3 |
| 5-9 users | Identify friction, iterate, retest |
| < 5 users | Stop or major pivot |

**Timeline**: Week 1-2 beta → Week 2 go/no-go → Week 3 launch (if validated) → Month 3: 20 users → Month 6: 8+ projects

---

**If MS/Resco announces native MCP**: Pivot to partnership (contribute, don't compete).

**Bottom line**: €37.5K bet. Speed play + Vibe Studio foundation. Even if commoditized, wins by accelerating Resco adoption. Validate adoption THIS WEEK, then decide.
