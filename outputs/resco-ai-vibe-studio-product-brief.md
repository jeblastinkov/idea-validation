## Resco AI Vibe Studio: Build enterprise mobile apps by describing them.

**For consultants and business app makers who need offline-capable mobile apps but don't have months to learn a new platform — so they go from idea to a working app on their phone in under an hour.**

---

### The Villain

You're a consultant who knows Dynamics, Salesforce, or ServiceNow inside out. Your client needs a mobile app that works in the field — no signal, no problem. But every platform that promises offline either locks you into one vendor, requires weeks of training on proprietary tools, or simply doesn't work when the network drops. So you're stuck: learn yet another complex tool, hire expensive specialists, or tell your client it can't be done.

---

### The Hero

Open your browser, describe the app you need in plain English, and watch it come to life. Resco AI Vibe Studio generates a complete mobile app that runs offline out of the box — with your client's real data from Dynamics, Salesforce, or ServiceNow already connected. Scan a QR code, and the app is on your phone. Change something with a follow-up prompt, and it updates live. No training. No proprietary tooling to master. Just describe, preview, deploy.

---

### The Magic

**Works offline, for real.** Your app keeps running with full data access even when there's no signal — encrypted, synced, and secure. Not a workaround. Not "limited mode." Real offline, proven by 2,500 companies in production.

**Any CRM, one app.** Connect to Dynamics 365, Salesforce, or ServiceNow — or all three. Build once, work everywhere. No vendor lock-in.

**Phone in minutes, not months.** Describe your app, scan a QR code, and it's on your device. What used to take weeks of configuration now takes less than an hour.

### Why Now?

AI-powered app builders are already here — Microsoft and Salesforce both launched theirs. But none of them work offline, and all of them lock you into a single backend. The window to own "offline-first, any-backend, AI-built" is 6 to 12 months. Wait, and someone else fills that gap.

### The Evidence

> 87% of Fortune 500 companies already use vibe coding platforms, and 60% of field service organizations plan to deploy in-field mobile apps within 3 years — yet most platforms still offer limited or no offline capability. (Sources: Collins/industry reports, Gartner)
