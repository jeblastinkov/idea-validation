**⚠️ Remember**: This canvas is a snapshot of assumptions. Everything marked "TBD" or listed as an assumption MUST be validated through customer conversations and experiments. The goal is not to perfect this canvas, but to identify and test the riskiest assumptions as quickly as possible.

**🎯 Focus**: Test the riskiest assumption first. Everything else is secondary.
