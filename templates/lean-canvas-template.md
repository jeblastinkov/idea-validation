## 🔑 Unfair Advantage

[What you have that can't be easily copied: IP, network, expertise, insider info]

*Note: It's OK if this is "TBD" - most early ideas don't have one yet*

---

## 📊 Channels

**Per-customer revenue**: [Unit economics, e.g., "50 users × $10/month × 24 months = $12,000"]

**Investment**:
- Build: [Cost to build MVP]
- Ongoing: [Annual operational costs]
- **Total Year 1**: [Build + ongoing]

**Break-even**: [Revenue needed] / [Per-customer revenue] = [X customers] = [~Y projects or time period]

**Forecast**: [Conservative estimate for Year 1] = [Expected revenue] = [Net profit/loss]

**Profitability**: [When you expect to be profitable]
