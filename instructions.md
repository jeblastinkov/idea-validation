# Business Idea Validation Framework

A practical guide for validating and creating business ideas using IT product best practices.

## Purpose

This repository helps you validate business ideas before building products, following proven methodologies from Lean Startup, SVPG (Silicon Valley Product Group), and modern product management practices.

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Lean Canvas
Complete the one-page business model to identify:
- Problem worth solving
- Customer segments
- Unique value proposition
- Solution approach
- Revenue streams and cost structure
- Key metrics
- Unfair advantage

### 2. SVPG Product Discovery
Apply continuous discovery techniques:
- Opportunity assessment
- Customer problem validation
- Prototype testing
- Product/market fit evaluation

### 3. Validation Stack
- **Problem validation**: Does the problem exist and matter?
- **Market validation**: Is there a viable market?
- **Solution validation**: Will your solution work?
- **Business validation**: Can you build a sustainable business?

## Getting Started

1. **Define the Problem**
   - Interview 5-10 potential customers
   - Document pain points and current solutions
   - Prioritize problems by severity and frequency

2. **Create Your Lean Canvas**
   - Fill out each section based on research
   - Make assumptions explicit
   - Update as you learn

3. **Test Assumptions**
   - List your riskiest assumptions
   - Design experiments to validate/invalidate them
   - Set success criteria before testing

4. **Build Evidence**
   - Customer interviews
   - Landing page tests
   - Concierge MVP
   - Prototype feedback

## Key Principles

- **Talk to customers first** - Build nothing until you validate the problem
- **Start with riskiest assumptions** - Test what could kill the idea
- **Iterate quickly** - Small experiments, fast learning cycles
- **Evidence over opinions** - Data and customer feedback guide decisions
- **Pivot or persevere** - Be willing to change direction based on learning
