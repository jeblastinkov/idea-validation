# Getting Started with Business Idea Validation

## Welcome

This guide will help you use the Business Idea Validation Agent to validate your business idea in under an hour.

## Before You Start

### What You Need

**Minimum**:
- A business idea (even rough/early stage is OK)
- Basic understanding of the problem
- 30-60 minutes of focused time

**Helpful (but not required)**:
- Customer research or conversations
- Competitive analysis
- Market size estimates
- Pricing ideas

### What You Don't Need

- A business plan ❌
- A working product ❌
- Funding ❌
- A team ❌
- Perfect answers to everything ❌

**It's OK to have unknowns!** The agent will help you identify what needs validation.

## Preparation (5 minutes)

### 1. Read the Lean Canvas Guide
Skim `/frameworks/lean-canvas.md` to understand the 9 building blocks.

### 2. Gather What You Know
Have ready (if available):
- Problem description
- Target customer details
- Competitor names
- Rough pricing ideas
- Market size guesses

### 3. Get Comfortable with "TBD"
You won't have all answers. That's the point!

The agent will help you:
- Identify what you don't know
- Mark it as "TBD - Requires validation"
- Prioritize what to test first

## The Validation Process (20-60 minutes)

### Skill 1: Problem Definition (5-10 min)

**Agent asks**: "What problem does your idea solve?"

**Your goal**: Define the specific problem, not a generic category.

❌ **Vague**: "People waste time on project management"
✅ **Specific**: "Dev teams can't track dependencies across multiple projects"

**Questions you'll answer**:
- What are the top 3 pain points?
- How do people solve this today?
- Why are current solutions inadequate?

**Tip**: If you don't know specifics, say so. The agent will help you mark it for customer research.

### Skill 2: Customer Segments (5-10 min)

**Agent asks**: "Who specifically experiences this problem?"

**Your goal**: Identify a specific, reachable customer segment.

❌ **Too broad**: "Small businesses"
✅ **Specific**: "Engineering managers at 50-200 person B2B SaaS companies"

**Questions you'll answer**:
- Who has this problem most acutely?
- What are their demographics/firmographics?
- Who are the early adopters?
- How can you reach them?

**Tip**: Start narrow. You can expand later. Better to own a niche than be lost in a broad market.

### Skill 3: Value Proposition (3-5 min)

**Agent asks**: "What makes your solution different?"

**Your goal**: Articulate unique value, not just "better."

❌ **Generic**: "We're faster and easier"
✅ **Unique**: "Real-time dependency mapping without manual updates"

**Questions you'll answer**:
- What's your unique insight or advantage?
- Why will customers choose you?
- What's your unfair advantage (if any)?

**Tip**: If you don't have an unfair advantage yet, that's OK. Most early ideas don't.

### Skill 4: Solution Overview (5-10 min)

**Agent asks**: "What are the top 3 features your MVP must have?"

**Your goal**: Define the minimum viable product.

❌ **Too much**: 10 features, AI, mobile app, integrations...
✅ **Minimal**: 3 core features that solve the 3 main problems

**Questions you'll answer**:
- What features solve the core problems?
- What's the delivery method?
- What's explicitly NOT included in MVP?

**Tip**: If you can't articulate why a feature is critical, it's probably not MVP.

### Skill 5: Market Validation (5-10 min)

**Agent asks**: "How big is this market? Who else is solving this?"

**Your goal**: Understand market size and competition.

**Questions you'll answer**:
- How many potential customers?
- What's the total market value?
- Who are the top 3 competitors/alternatives?
- How are you different from each?

**Tip**: Competition validates demand. "No competition" usually means no market or you haven't looked hard enough.

### Skill 6: Business Model (5-10 min)

**Agent asks**: "How will you make money?"

**Your goal**: Define revenue model and costs.

**Questions you'll answer**:
- How will customers pay? (subscription, one-time, usage, etc.)
- What's the price point?
- What are your major costs?
- How will you acquire customers?

**Tip**: It's OK to have a pricing range. You'll validate the exact number with customers.

### Skill 7: Key Metrics (3-5 min)

**Agent asks**: "How will you measure success?"

**Your goal**: Identify the metrics that matter.

**Questions you'll answer**:
- What's your North Star metric (the one number that matters most)?
- What supporting metrics will you track?
- What result would prove/disprove this idea?

**Tip**: Focus on metrics that show real customer value, not vanity metrics.

### Skill 8: Risks & Assumptions (5-10 min)

**Agent asks**: "What could kill this idea?"

**Your goal**: Identify the riskiest assumptions.

**Questions you'll answer**:
- What are the top 3 risks?
- What are you assuming that might not be true?
- What's the riskiest assumption?
- How will you test it?

**Tip**: Be honest. Investors and teams respect founders who know their risks.

### Skill 9: Generate Output (2-3 min)

The agent compiles everything into a one-page Lean Canvas.

**You'll review**:
- Summary of all information
- Gaps or assumptions marked "TBD"
- Riskiest assumption highlighted

**You'll receive**:
- Markdown file: `/outputs/[your-idea]-validation-canvas.md`
- Specific next action
- Testing priority

## After Validation

### Your One-Page Canvas

You now have a comprehensive validation canvas with:
- ✅ Problem and customer clearly defined
- ✅ Solution and value proposition articulated
- ✅ Business model outlined
- ✅ Key risks identified
- ✅ Next steps prioritized

### What to Do Next

#### 1. Test Riskiest Assumption First

The agent highlights your biggest risk. Test it immediately.

**Example risks**:
- "Customers will pay $99/month" → Get 10 customer interviews and ask about pricing
- "Dev teams have this problem" → Interview 15 engineering managers
- "We can build this with our tech" → Build proof of concept

**Don't build the full product until you validate the riskiest assumption!**

#### 2. Update Your Canvas

As you learn, update your canvas:
- Change "TBD" to actual data
- Update assumptions with evidence
- Pivot if necessary

**The canvas is a living document.**

#### 3. Run Validation Experiments

For each major assumption:

**Problem validation**:
- Customer interviews (10-15 minimum)
- Observe them using current solutions
- Quantify pain (hours wasted, money lost, etc.)

**Solution validation**:
- Mockups/prototypes
- Smoke tests (landing page with "Sign up")
- Concierge MVP (manual delivery)

**Price validation**:
- Ask about budget in interviews
- Test willingness to pay with pre-orders
- Compare to current solution costs

**Channel validation**:
- Small paid experiments
- Content marketing tests
- Partnership conversations

#### 4. Decide: Build, Pivot, or Stop

After validation:

**Build**: If assumptions are validated
- Riskiest assumptions tested ✓
- Customers confirmed they'll pay ✓
- Market is reachable ✓
- You have unfair advantage ✓

**Pivot**: If some assumptions failed
- Problem is different than you thought
- Different customer segment has more pain
- Different solution is needed

**Stop**: If core assumptions are invalid
- No one has this problem (or cares enough)
- Market is too small
- Can't build sustainable advantage

## Tips for Success

### During Validation

1. **Be honest about unknowns**
   - "I don't know" is a valid answer
   - Mark it "TBD" and make it a research priority

2. **Be specific**
   - Generic answers get challenged
   - Specificity = actionability

3. **Quantify when possible**
   - "Engineering managers" → "Engineering managers at 50-200 person companies"
   - "Expensive" → "$50K per year"

4. **Challenge yourself**
   - The agent will push you
   - This makes your idea stronger

### After Validation

1. **Test assumptions, don't build blindly**
   - Talk to customers before writing code
   - Validate pricing before building features
   - Prove demand before scaling

2. **Update continuously**
   - Your canvas will change as you learn
   - That's progress, not failure

3. **Share with team/advisors**
   - Use canvas to align on priorities
   - Get feedback on assumptions
   - Build shared understanding

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Rushing Through
Don't speed through just to finish. Take time to think.

### ❌ Being Too Optimistic
The agent challenges you for a reason. Listen to the pushback.

### ❌ Skipping Customer Research
You can't validate from your desk. Talk to customers!

### ❌ Building Before Validating
Code is expensive. Validation is cheap. Do it in that order.

### ❌ Ignoring the Risks
The riskiest assumption is what you test first, not last.

## Example Timeline

**Week 1**: Complete validation canvas (1 hour)
**Week 2-3**: Customer interviews (10-15 people)
**Week 4**: Update canvas based on learning
**Week 5-6**: Test riskiest assumption (pricing, mockup, prototype)
**Week 7**: Decide: Build MVP, Pivot, or Stop

**Total: 7 weeks from idea to validated direction**

Much faster (and cheaper) than building for 6 months then finding out no one wants it.

**You're ready!** Start your validation conversation and build something people actually want.

**Remember**: The goal isn't a perfect canvas. It's identifying what you don't know and testing it before you invest months building the wrong thing.

Good luck! 🚀
